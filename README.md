Passepartout is your go-to app for VPN and privacy.

Passepartout runs on [iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV][web-appstore].

## Features

[OpenVPN®][openvpn] and [WireGuard®][wireguard] client for Apple platforms, the OpenVPN stack also implements the [Tunnelblick XOR patch][openvpn-xor-patch].

Other features:

- On-demand rules
- Override DNS and HTTP proxy
- Custom routing
- Presets for multiple providers (virtually any)

Tailored for Apple platforms:

- Apple TV
- iCloud
- Shortcuts
- No background activities
- Wise on battery

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 16+ / macOS 13+ / tvOS 17+
- Xcode 16+
- SwiftPM 6.0
- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)
- Ruby (preinstalled with macOS)

It's highly recommended that you use the Git and Ruby packages provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].

### Testing

Download the app codebase locally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout.git

For everything to work properly, you must comply with all the capabilities and entitlements in the main app and the tunnel extension target. Therefore, you must update the `Config.xcconfig` file according to your developer account.

To eventually test the app, open `Passepartout.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the `Passepartout` target.

**WARNING: SwiftPM package resolution will fail because PassepartoutKit is a private repository, as it's not ready for public use yet.** [Follow updates here](https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/issues/793).
