Passepartout is a smart VPN client perfectly integrated with Apple platforms. Passepartout is the only app you need for both well-known VPN providers and your personal VPN servers.

Passepartout does not engage any unrequested background activity other than the VPN tunnel, thus being also friendlier to firewalls.

Passepartout is open source: https://github.com/passepartoutvpn
