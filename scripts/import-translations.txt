I need translations in the following languages:

- German
- Greek
- Spanish
- French
- Italian
- Dutch
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Swedish
- Ukranian
- Chinese (Simplified)

of these lines, except the key:

<<< list of "key" = "string"; >>>

I need the result in a single output, but prefix each language with a comment with its language code, e.g. for English:

// en

Remember that Chinese language code is zh-Hans.

Thanks!
